                <h2>1st Turning Point</h2>
                <p>I remember a year when I was not able to solve simple mathematical problems. I used to be messing up at that time. But the year 2012 was the first turning point in my life. A year that flip, everything in my life. Nobody could ever imagine that a single incident could lead up to such a massive change. </p>
             <p>
In summer, it was a beautiful warm, sunny day and everything was going as usual. We were at our school doing studies, making fun of each other, but nobody could never imagine that one line of a joke could hurt our class topper that much he challenged me in front of the whole class. I accepted that in front of my classmates, but deep inside me, I was so afraid because I knew I do not have any chance to win, even everyone present in that room was so sure that I'm not going to stand even for one minute. Everyone started making jokes about me. I was so depressed and afraid that after returning from school, I cried all day long. At Night, on that day, I decided to show everyone who I'm and what I can do. I lift my books and solve math problems. I was so focused that I didn't even show up in school for two days. Everyone starts thinking that I run away. After two days, when I showed up in school, everyone starts bullying me. I didn't even say a word to anyone. After a while, we started our competition at school, Everyone was so amazed and shocked that how could I'm doing this. After 1 hour of solving and fighting, the competition comes to an end.</p> </div>

       <p>      The results were surprising for all, even for me too. Just imagine a guy who doesn't even know how to calculate  L.C.M. would fight the competition. Not even fight only, would even give a tough fight.
 No one would ever think that I had a chance to win, everyone was looking forward to my win. But, the sad truth is lost that day. At that time,  I was freaked out. I thought now everyone would make fun of me again. But at that moment everyone was praising and cheering me up.</p></div>

                <p>On that day, I realized that if I could able to hit him so hard by just two days of practice, then what could I do if I kept on my practice and have a belief in me. At the end of 2012, my hard work paid off well. I represented my school at the National Level in the math Olympiad.
So, that was the point in my life which changed my perspective and enhanced my confidence. In short, that one paid off changes everything and after that, I never looked back from that day till now. For me, you achieve your goal, the day when you start trusting yourself, and that changes your whole future, your destiny. You can find your path and even able to make your path to achieve your destination. </p>
